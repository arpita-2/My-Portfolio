          <h3 style="margin: 0;">Lost In Nature</h3>
          <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            My Writings on the one of the Beautiful state of Northeastern Region of India - Arunachal Pradesh.
            I born in Arunachal Pradesh.It's beauty is matchless to none.
            In the far northeastern corner of India lies Arunachal Pradesh, the Wild East of Indian tourism. Within its borders, snow-capped Himalayas encircle pristine golden valleys, and 24 unique tribes are scattered throughout its demanding, but photogenic, terrain. The Shangri La of the northeastern states, it begs to be explored, but is often ignored.
        
            The easternmost of all Indian states, Arunachal Pradesh is far-removed from the Indian mainland, infrastructure is poor at best, and it requires pesky permits from both Indian and foreign tourists alike.
            It is situated near the Assam. It is the largest state of North-east India.
            The places here are surrounded by Nature. The famous places to travel here are Tawang, Itanagar,
            Bomdila, Tezu, West-Siang, Passighat. Lots of Buddist Monasteries are prsent in Arunachal Pradesh.
            I have done my higher school education from there, so lots of memories are present on my mind about this beautiful state.
            You can come here through bus and the facility of train is only provided from Naharlagun(Arunachal Pradesh)
            to Guwahati(Assam). 

            The flight facility has been recently given on Tezu District. You can visit Parshuram Kund here and its very famous place.
            I recommending to all of people that come once on Arunachal Pradesh and enjoy your vacation.
            Explore this state , Explore the beauty of it. I know people will really enjoy.

          <h3 style="margin: 0;">Nandi Hills</h3>
          <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">

            I visited Nandi Hills on 26th November 2020.
            Ideal for both a quick getaway and a long refreshing escape, Nandi is an absolute paradise to be in.

            Being a small hill station in Karnataka, this place can be reached by all modes of commute, i.e. by air, train, and road, but not directly except by road.
