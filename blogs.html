          <h3 style="margin: 0;">Lost In Nature</h3>
          <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            My Writings on the one of the Beautiful state of Northeastern Region of India -<span style="color: blue"></span> Arunachal Pradesh.</span>
            I born in Arunachal Pradesh.It's beauty is matchless to none.
            In the far northeastern corner of India lies Arunachal Pradesh, the Wild East of Indian tourism. Within its borders, snow-capped Himalayas encircle pristine golden valleys, and 24 unique tribes are scattered throughout its demanding, but photogenic, terrain. The Shangri La of the northeastern states, it begs to be explored, but is often ignored.
        
            The easternmost of all Indian states, Arunachal Pradesh is far-removed from the Indian mainland, infrastructure is poor at best, and it requires pesky permits from both Indian and foreign tourists alike.
            It is situated near the Assam. It is the largest state of North-east India.
            The places here are surrounded by Nature. The famous places to travel here are Tawang, Itanagar,
            Bomdila, Tezu, West-Siang, Passighat. Lots of Buddist Monasteries are prsent in Arunachal Pradesh.
            I have done my higher school education from there, so lots of memories are present on my mind about this beautiful state.
            You can come here through bus and the facility of train is only provided from Naharlagun(Arunachal Pradesh)
            to Guwahati(Assam). 

            The flight facility has been recently given on Tezu District. You can visit Parshuram Kund here and its very famous place.
            I recommending to all of people that come once on Arunachal Pradesh and enjoy your vacation.
            Explore this state , Explore the beauty of it. I know people will really enjoy.

          <h3 style="margin: 0;">Nandi Hills</h3>
          <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">

            I visited<span style="color: blue"> Nandi Hills</span> on 26th November 2020.
            Ideal for both a quick getaway and a long refreshing escape, Nandi is an absolute paradise to be in.

            Being a small hill station in Karnataka, this place can be reached by all modes of commute, i.e. by air, train, and road, but not directly except by road.
            Basically reach at 6am, to watch the beautiful sunrise. Go at weekends , you will enjoy.
            I get up and got ready at Early Morning.I started journey at 4:30AM from Avalahalli Bangalore.
            Nandi Hills, Once I turned in to the Nandi Hills road from the National Highway, the experience was really awsome. On the way to the hill top,
             I stopped and had tea, you will feel amazing having the cup of tea on cloudy day with fresh air and beautiful morning.
             
             
             After capturing nice view, I went to have breakfast. You will find restaurants with nice taste, I had maggie, vada and of course poori sabji!!!
 yeah what else you need in your life if you get maggie and tea on top of hill where you surrounded with cloud.


             I ate some roasted corn also. please wear a jacket or any kind of warmer because it is very cold there
             Garden are also available there you can roam and BEWARE OF MONKEYS !!! guys.
             Lots of monkeys are available there so don't do anything with them.
             You can watch sunset view also. Although the experience of mine was really good.

          <h3 style="margin: 0;">My Hometown</h3>
          <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">

            My Hometown is in Tripura. The district is<span style="color: blue"> Dharmanagar</span>where i lived. Actually Tripura is the smallest state of North-eastern Region
            of India. There are hardly 7-8 districts are present and Dharmanagar is the second largest District in Tripura.
             I went on my Hometown first time at the age of 6 and after that i went at the age of 12. So when i visit there second time
             I was totally shocked because there was huge changes i have seen. The development growth rate is good there.
             You can reach there through Train and bus From Assam. It takes hardly 9 hours to reach at my hometown.
             Although the district is very small as compare to other district of other states but i loved my hometown.
             The culture prsent on Tripura is very good. You will get sweet people and they will help you definetly if you face any kind of trouble.

             Tripura is a hilly state in northeastern India bordered by Bangladesh on three sides and home to a varied mix of tribal cultures and religious groups.
             although there are no famous places to visit on my hometown but you can visit bangladesh border here beacause its nearby only.

             You can visit other districts of Tripura if you are planning for a vacation.
             The imposing Ujjayanta Palace is set among Mughal gardens in the capital Agartala, and the Mosque of Gedu Mia has white marble dome and towers. Neermahal Summer Palace is located in
              Lake Rudrasagar in the south of the city and combines Hindu and Islamic architecture.

              <span style="color: blue">My suggestion is if you want to come Tripura then visit it on october-march.</span>
